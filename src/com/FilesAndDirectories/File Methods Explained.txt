There are dozens of ways to create, read, write and delete a file in java language!
Some of them:
- (char-2 byte stream)File.createNewFile(), FileWriter.write(), FileReader.read() (Generic usage, Programmer have to create multiple objects handle everything manually) -> classical way
- (byte-1 byte stream)FileOutputStream() constructor (Practical for reading and writing data files!)    -> c++ input and output streams but with bytes
- BufferedXXXX(BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream, ...) -> intermediate class to improve performance
- Files.write() -> nio package, a new way, without creating object
- Scanner -> FileReader or BufferedReader with parsing. you can use it with any type of data(Strings, Files, System.in, ...). hasNext and next series of methods are two important series.
- System.in -> standart input can be used with other file operations ;)

# Directories
- java.io.File class
- java.nio.Files static methods -> gives extra powers
